Challenge 1 – Can computers be used to create art?
https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/admissions/python-challenge-1-can-computers-be-used-create-art

Target:
1.	Plot a circle, using the parametric equation above.
2.	Find the parametric equation for Fermat’s Spiral (online), and therefore plot the spiral.
3.	Do the same for the Butterﬂy Curve.

I had not used the required matplotlib library before, so I had to do some experimenting before creating my first circle

However after learning the basics and having its documentation on hand I was able to plot a circle using the provided parametric equation

And here is a spiral of 200000/10000 <br />

Then I began on the butterfly, which I thought would be significantly more difficult until I found the simple equation - the only new thing I had to do was find out how to use eulers function un num.py <br />
